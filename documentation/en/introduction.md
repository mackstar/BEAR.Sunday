# BEAR.Sunday

## BEAR.Sunday is an elegant, no-mess, 'Zen' inspired framework from Japan.

This resource orientated framework has both externally and internally a REST centric architecture, 
implementing 'Dependency Injection' and 'Aspect Orientated Programming' heavily to offer you surprising simplicity, 
order and flexibility in your application.

With very few components of its own, it is a fantastic example of how a framework can be built using 
existing components and libraries from other frameworks, yet offer even further benefit and beauty.

## Resource Orientated Framework

In BEAR.Sunday `everything` is a REST resource which leads to far simpler design and extensibility.
Interactions with your database, services and even pages and sections of your app all sit comfortably in a 
resource which can be consumed or rendered at will.
