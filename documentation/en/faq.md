# Runtime Problems 
## Annotations 
### `Semantical Error` annotation Exception 

This is an exception when the annotation class is unknown.

If there are problems in reading annotations then either the auto-loader is having problems or the `use` naming resolution is has not worked. â€»The class loader used for Doctrine annotations is separate.

Resolution
 * Import using `use`. 
 * In the application boot location (App.php etc) manually import the annotation class or [http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-common/en/latest/reference/annotations.html setup the autoloader].
 * Set annotations using their full path.
