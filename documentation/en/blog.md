# Getting Started 

This in this tutorial we create a simple blog application in BEAR.Sunday that is similar to the
[http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/tutorials-and-examples/blog/blog.html CakePHP Blog Tutorial]  or [http://tutorial.symblog.co.uk/ Symfony2 Blog Tutorial].

We will install BEAR.Sunday, perform the database settings, and create application logic to show a posts list page, add, edit and delete.

By studying this tutorial at the same time as getting basic grasp of the BEAR.Sunday development cycle you can also compare to how this might be done in CakePHP or Symfony.

## Set-up Environment and Requirements
