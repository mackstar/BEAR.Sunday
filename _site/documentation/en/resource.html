     <h1 id="toc_0">summary Resource Introduction</h1>

<h1 id="toc_1">Introduction</h1>

<h2 id="toc_2">Representational State Transfer</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">REST</a> (Representational State Transfer) was first introduced in a doctorate paper in 2000 by key creator of the HTTP specification Roy Fielding.</p>

<p>A resource is a clump of information containing meaning. A representation is created from the resource state and then passed to the client. This what REST (Representational State Transfer) is. For example stock information is a resource. From that state to a HTML page representation is created then passed to a web browser and becomes a stock information page. This is REST.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Application Resource</h2>

<p>In an MVC framework just like a controller accesses a model, in BEAR.Sunday a page resource requests an application resource.</p>

<p>The model does not deal with data in an object based architecture instead deals with the data as a REST resource. The resource functions as a layer, internal procedures or objects can be wrapped and served as a resource. The resource client does not deal directly with an instance, 
the resource object retrieved using a URI is processed through a request interface. </p>

<p>Object Model</p>

<p>|| <em>cart:</em> || show, addItem, remoteItem, addCoupon, removeCoupon, increaseQuantity, decreaseQuantity ||</p>

<p>REST</p>

<p>|| <em><code>cart</code>* || get, post, put, delete || 
|| *<code>cart/item</code>* || get, post, put, delete || 
|| *<code>cart/coupon</code></em> || get, post, put, delete || </p>

<h2 id="toc_4">ROA(Resource Orientated Architecture)</h2>

<p>A BEAR resource also just like an HTTP Application carries the following 4 ROA([<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-oriented_architecture">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource-oriented_architecture</a> Resource Orientated Architecture） Benefits</p>

<ul>
<li>Addressability</li>
<li>Unified Interface</li>
<li>Statelessness</li>
<li>Connectedness (Links)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="toc_5">Addressability</h3>

<p>A resource has a URI like a web URL.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">app://self/blog/posts/?id=3
</code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">page://self/index
</code></pre></div>
<p>The equivalent to a MVC model is an application resource. In BEAR.Sunday a resource functions as an internal API, but as it is designed using REST it also works as an external API transport. In BEAR.Sunday the <code>Page</code> that carries out the page controller role is also a resource. A page according to its URL calls an application resource and builds itself.</p>

<p>A resource respects <code>the concern of each domain</code>. In order to build itself an article displaying <em>page</em> resource sets its own contents by setting its body property with an <code>Article application resource</code>. Here no concern is paid to the page article details. The role of the page is to bind part of itself to application resource request.</p>

<p>The schema expresses each individual domain (data structure) such as <code>app</code>, <code>page</code> and others just like <code>http</code> is available for the user to register. For example as a specified schema <code>office://self/room/meething/reservation/?room=3</code> etc and traditional information systems can provide a new URI.</p>

<p>For more information on custom schema&#39;s and other service request details then please see [resource_adapter Resource Adapter]. Furthermore <code>self</code> represents ones own service. It is an identifier to to be able to distinguish from other services.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Uniform Interface</h3>

<p>The resource state (data) operates though an interface. That operation is run by the resource client. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s think of it as an HTTP Application. A resource can be requested from an HTTP client, however that it is limited to the predetermined uniform methods GET/PUT/POST...etc. No matter what the resource these methods will not change.</p>

<p>BEAR.Sunday resources also have 4 interfaces conforming to the 4 HTTP methods.</p>

<p>|| GET || Resource retrieval ||
|| PUT || Resource update and creation ||
|| POST || Resource creation ||
|| DELETE || Resource delete ||
|| OPTIONS || Resource access method query ||</p>

<h4 id="toc_7">GET</h4>

<p>Resource reading. This method does not provide any changing of the resource state. A safe method with no side affects.</p>

<h4 id="toc_8">PUT</h4>

<p>Performs resource updates and also creation. This method has the benefit that even if you run it once, running it many more times will have no more effect. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">Idempotence</a>.</p>

<h4 id="toc_9">POST</h4>

<p>Performs resource creation. If you run the request multiple times the resource will be created that many times. A method with no idempotence.</p>

<h4 id="toc_10">DELETE</h4>

<p>Resource deletion. Has idempotence just as PUT.</p>

<h4 id="toc_11">OPTIONS</h4>

<p>Inspects which methods and parameters can be used on the resource. Just like <code>GET</code> there is no effect on the resource.</p>

<h2 id="toc_12">Stateless</h2>

<p>This means that there is no state involved in the resource request.</p>

<p>For example there is a state in the request when accessing a model object.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">$user = new User;
$user-&gt;setUserId($id); 
$name = $user-&gt;getName(); // Follows the premise that there is state through the setting of $id
</code></pre></div>
<p>In a resource request there is no state.
<code>
$name = $resource
  -&gt;get
  -&gt;uri(&#39;app://self/user&#39;)
  -&gt;eager
  -&gt;request([&#39;id&#39; =&gt; 1)
  -&gt;body[&#39;name&#39;];
</code></p>

<h2 id="toc_13">Link</h2>

<p>A resource can link to other resources. For example a user resource can be linked to a blog resource by a <em>blog link</em>. A blog resource can be linked to a article resource via a <em>latest articles link</em> or <em>popular posts link</em>.</p>

<p>A link encapsulates the resource internals, externally from a resource you only need to follow the link. It is an just like an HTML <code>a</code> tag. The link info set by an <code>href</code> is not managed by the client but only used. Even the link location changes there is no change in the the way the link is handled.</p>

<p>A DB relationship or association is independent and so for example if a specific DB data column cam be linked to a http resource using a Web API or linked to data (a resource) crossing a schema.</p>

<h1 id="toc_14">REST and BEAR.Sunday</h1>

<p>If all of this sounds quite abstract to you, you are right — REST in itself is a high-level style that could be implemented using many different technologies, and instantiated using different values for its abstract properties. For example, REST includes the concepts of resources and a uniform interface — i.e. the idea that every resource should respond to the same methods. But REST doesn&#39;t say which methods these should be, or how many of them there should be.</p>

<p>One <code>incarnation</code> of the REST style is HTTP (and a set of related set of standards, such as URIs), or slightly more abstractly: the Web’s architecture itself. To continue the example from above, HTTP “instantiates” the REST uniform interface with a particular one, consisting of the HTTP verbs. (<a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/rest-introduction">http://www.infoq.com/articles/rest-introduction</a>)</p>

<p>At the core of BEAR.Sunday is REST. It behaves like HTTP or web architecture by retrieving a clump of data/process as a resource. BEAR.Sunday as an API or a web framework collects and builds up these resources.</p>
